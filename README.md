# Playground
The playground editor is a web-based code editor that allows you to write, run, and test your code directly in the browser. It provides a convenient and interactive environment for experimenting with code snippets, prototyping ideas, and learning new programming concepts.

Features of the playground editor include:
- Syntax highlighting: The editor highlights different parts of your code with different colors to make it easier to read and understand.
- Auto-completion: The editor suggests code completions as you type, helping you write code faster and with fewer errors.
- Error checking: The editor detects and highlights syntax errors and other issues in your code, allowing you to fix them before running the code.
- Run and debug: You can execute your code directly in the editor and see the output or debug any issues that arise.
- Version control: The editor integrates with version control systems like Git, allowing you to manage and track changes to your code.

Using the playground editor, you can quickly iterate on your code, experiment with different approaches, and collaborate with others in real-time. It is a powerful tool for both beginners and experienced developers to write and test code without the need for a local development environment.
